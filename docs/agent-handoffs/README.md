# Agent Handoffs

This folder stores reusable knowledge so future agents can work faster and safer.

## Folders

- `learnings/`: successful patterns and repeatable implementation guidance.
- `incidents/`: failures, root causes, and mitigation/prevention notes.

## Filename format

Use: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-topic.md`

Examples:

- `2026-02-14-validation-before-summary.md`
- `2026-02-14-lock-timeout-regression.md`

Keep names generic and descriptive.

## Required note structure

Every note should include:

- Context
- Observation
- Action taken
- Validation performed
- Recommendation for next agents

## Writing guidelines

- Keep entries short and actionable.
- Include exact commands when helpful.
- Avoid secrets or user-identifying data.
- Prefer generic language unless you are in a specific downstream project repository.
