# Example Learning: Validation Before Summary

- **Context:** Multi-file documentation update.
- **Observation:** Running quick checks before writing summaries catches avoidable mistakes.
- **Action taken:** Ran status and diff checks before finalizing.
- **Validation performed:** Confirmed expected files changed and no accidental edits were included.
- **Recommendation for next agents:** Always run at least one verification command after edits and before committing.
