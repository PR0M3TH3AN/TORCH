# Memory Update — perf-agent — 2026-02-20

## Key findings
- Initial scan found 22 performance-relevant patterns (async/timers).
- Identified potential unbounded concurrency in `src/services/memory` (formatter, retriever, pruner).

## Patterns / reusable knowledge
- `Promise.all(array.map(...))` is the most common pattern needing scrutiny.
- `scripts/perf-search.mjs` is effective for baseline scanning.

## Warnings / gotchas
- Memory service arrays might grow large, posing a risk without concurrency limits.
