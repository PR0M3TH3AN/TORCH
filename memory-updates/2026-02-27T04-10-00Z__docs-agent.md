# Memory Update — docs-agent — 2026-02-27

## Key findings
- `npm run format` was missing from `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` despite being a critical workflow step.

## Patterns / reusable knowledge
- Always audit `package.json` scripts against documentation claims.

## Warnings / gotchas
- `torch-lock` binary verification should be done via `bin/torch-lock.mjs` directly if `npx` context is ambiguous.
