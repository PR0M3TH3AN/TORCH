# Memory Update — audit-agent 2026-02-19

## Key findings from first audit run

### File size baseline (first run — 20 oversized files)
- TORCH.md: 459 lines (limit 300, excess 159) — documentation, expected large
- landing/index.html: 1361 lines (excess 1061) — highest priority for size reduction
- src/lock-ops.mjs: 890 lines (excess 590) — core module, candidate for decomposition
- scripts/agent/run-scheduler-cycle.mjs: 791 lines (excess 491) — orchestration script
- perf/constants-refactor/candidates.json: 1668 lines (excess 1368) — generated data file; may warrant exclusion from size check

### innerHTML baseline (6 assignments across 2 files)
- landing/index.html: 4 innerHTML assignments
- dashboard/index.html: 2 innerHTML assignments
- Low count; not an immediate security risk but worth tracking for trends

### Lint baseline (42 warnings, 0 errors)
- All warnings are no-unused-vars
- lint passes (exit 0)
- Top lint file: src/lock-ops.mjs (7 warnings)

## Patterns observed
- `audit-report` GitHub label did not exist; needed to create before posting issue
- First-run: no prior issues with label `audit-report` — label was created as part of this run
- Check file sizes and innerHTML scripts exit 0 even with findings (report mode)
- npm run lint exits 0 with only warnings (no blocking errors)

## Recommendations for future audit-agent runs
- Compare against this run's metrics for delta computation
- All 20 oversized files are known/existing; any new ones beyond this list are regressions
- innerHTML count of 6 is the baseline; increases warrant investigation
- 42 lint warnings is the baseline; new errors (not warnings) should be escalated
