## Summary
Audited repository documentation for accuracy and alignment with codebase.

## Actions
- Verified `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` against `package.json` scripts.
- Verified `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Confirmed that documented commands (`npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit:lock-backend`) function correctly.
- Created run artifacts for `context`, `todo`, `decisions`, and `test_logs`.

## Results
- Documentation is accurate.
- No discrepancies found requiring updates.
