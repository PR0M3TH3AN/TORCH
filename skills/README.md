# Agent Skills

This folder is a lightweight, repository-local learning path for agents.

Use it to store reusable skill guides that help agents complete tasks in this repository without rediscovering context.

## How agents should use this folder

1. Start with `skills/torch-basics.md` for the default TORCH workflow.
2. Open only the skill file that matches the current task.
3. Follow the skill exactly, then fall back to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for unresolved questions.

## Skill file template

Each skill should stay generic and include:

- **Purpose**
- **When to use**
- **Inputs needed**
- **Steps**
- **Validation**
- **Output expectations**

## Current skills

- `torch-basics.md` — baseline setup, scheduler flow, and validation commands for this repository.
