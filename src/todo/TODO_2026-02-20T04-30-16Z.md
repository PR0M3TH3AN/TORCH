# TODO

## Completed
- Read baseline policy and scheduler shared-agent contract docs before implementation.
- Executed memory retrieval workflow and reviewed `.scheduler-memory/latest/daily/memories.md`.
- Reworked `scripts/agent/load-test.mjs` for safety checks, deterministic seeded generation, bounded in-flight publish control, and richer metrics/reporting.
- Ran dry-run harness execution and lint validation.
- Generated updated load-test JSON/Markdown reports in `reports/load-test/`.

## Pending
- Store post-run memory notes via configured memory storage command.
- Hand off results to scheduler (no `lock:complete`, no final task log ownership).
