# TODO (20260220T041302Z)

- [x] Validate roster-to-prompt alignment.
- [x] Audit prompts for stale path/script references.
- [x] Inspect recent failed task logs for prompt-caused failures.
- [x] Fix high-impact stale prompts (`content-audit-agent`, `pr-review-agent`, `smoke-agent`, `repo-fit-agent`).
- [x] Re-run scheduler prompt validation.
- [x] Update KNOWN_ISSUES status for resolved content-audit scope issue.
- [ ] Hand off summary to scheduler (no lock completion/final task-log publishing by spawned agent).
