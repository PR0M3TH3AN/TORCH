# Test Log - docs-code-investigator - 2026-02-27T03-12-00Z

Prompt: src/prompts/daily/docs-code-investigator.md

## Commands
- Command: `npm run lint`
- Command: `npm test src/services/memory/index.js`

## Results
- Result: Passed (0 errors).
- Result: Passed (all tests in `src/services/memory/index.js` related logic).
    *   Note: There are failures in the full test suite output (15 failed out of 383), but these appear unrelated to the documentation changes in `src/services/memory/index.js`. The failures seem to be in `verify-run-artifacts` logic (tests 194-197) or other integration tests not touched by this change. The `torch-config` and `memory` related tests passed.
    *   (Known Issue: `verify-run-artifacts` tests often fail in partial runs or due to environment differences. Tracked in incident: INC-2026-02-27-01).

## Artifacts Checked
-   `src/services/memory/index.js` (modified with JSDoc/comments)
-   `docs/memory-service-index-overview.md` (created)

## Issues
- Issue: 15 failed tests in unrelated modules (tracked as INC-2026-02-27-01).
- Issue: `verify-run-artifacts` tests often fail in partial runs (tracked as INC-2026-02-27-01).
