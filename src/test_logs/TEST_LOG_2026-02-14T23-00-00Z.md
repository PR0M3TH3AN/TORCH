# Test Log: dashboard/index.html innerHTML Migration

- **Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Agent:** innerhtml-migration-agent
- **Test Command:** `node scripts/check-innerhtml.mjs --report`

## Results

### Before
`dashboard/index.html`: 4 assignments

### After
`dashboard/index.html`: 0 assignments (not listed in report)

### Linting
`npm run lint` passed (warnings unrelated to changes).

### Verification
- `dashboard/domUtils.js` created and verified.
- `dashboard/index.html` modified to use `createElement` and `replaceChildren`.
- `innerHTML` usage removed from `dashboard/index.html`.
- **Note**: The `check-innerhtml.mjs` script does not support `--update` or `BASELINE` tracking, so the baseline update step was skipped.

## Manual Verification Simulation
- Verified that `createElement` correctly mimics the structure of the original `innerHTML` templates.
- Ensured `escapeHtml` is available (though `createElement` + `textContent` handles escaping naturally for text nodes).
- Checked for potential regressions: None found in static analysis.
