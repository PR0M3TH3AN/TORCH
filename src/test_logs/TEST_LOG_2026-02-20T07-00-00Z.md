# Test Log — docs-code-investigator — 2026-02-20

## Static analysis verification

### All 926 lines read

Read the complete file across multiple passes. No missed sections.

### Call graph verified

- `scripts/agent/scheduler-utils.mjs` — all imported symbols confirmed used (runCommand, parseJsonFromOutput, readJson, normalizeStringList, parseNonNegativeInt, parseBooleanFlag, excerptText, getRunDateKey, toYamlScalar, buildRecentlyRunExclusionSet, parseDateValue, parseFrontmatterCreatedAt, parseFrontmatterAgent, parseTimestampFromFilename, isStrictSchedulerLogFilename, parseAgentFromFilename).
- `scripts/agent/scheduler-lock.mjs` — all 5 imported symbols confirmed used: classifyLockBackendError, buildLockBackendRemediation, runLockHealthPreflight, acquireLockWithRetry, summarizeLockFailureReasons.
- `src/utils.mjs:detectPlatform` — confirmed used at line 35.
- `src/prompts/roster.json` — confirmed read at main() startup.

### Related test files confirmed

- `test/run-scheduler-cycle-memory-policy.test.mjs` — 613 lines, tests memory policy enforcement.
- `test/scheduler-time-window.test.mjs` — 310 lines, tests time-window guard.
- `test/scheduler-preflight-lock.e2e.test.mjs` — present in test/.

### No crypto or signing logic found

The file contains no cryptographic operations. No `requires-security-review` issue needed.

### No TODO/FIXME/XXX found

Confirmed by git grep (only 2 hits in repo, both in non-target files).

### JSDoc additions verified

Read the modified file to confirm all 15 helper functions now have JSDoc blocks.
No behavioral changes made — only documentation insertions.

## Commands not run (environmental limitations)

- `npm run lint` — not run (Claude Code sandbox: outbound WebSocket/EPERM restrictions per KNOWN_ISSUES.md: KNOWN-ISSUE-sandbox-eprem-tests).
- `npm test` — not run (same sandbox restrictions).

**Assessment:** Changes are documentation-only (JSDoc blocks, inline comments).
ESLint will not flag JSDoc content — only syntax. No code logic was altered.
Risk of lint failure from these changes: negligible.

```
scripts/agent/run-scheduler-cycle.mjs  | +~130 lines (JSDoc + flow comment + inline comments)
