# Test Log — docs-agent — 2026-02-20

## Verification: package.json scripts

**Method:** Read `package.json` and compared against commands in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

**Result:** PASS

Verified scripts exist:
- `npm test` ✓
- `npm run build` ✓
- `npm run lint` ✓
- `npm run test:unit:lock-backend` ✓
- `npm run test:extended-main` ✓
- `npm run validate:scheduler` ✓
- `npm run lock:check:daily` ✓
- `npm run lock:check:weekly` ✓
- `npm run lock:list` ✓
- `npm run lock:health` ✓
- `npm run lock:complete` ✓
- `npm run scheduler:daily` ✓
- `npm run scheduler:weekly` ✓
- `npm run report:lock-reliability` ✓
- `npm run dashboard:serve` ✓

No `npm run format` script exists — CONTRIBUTING.md does not reference it (only `npm run lint`). No discrepancy.

## Verification: referenced paths

**Method:** Used Glob to check file existence for all paths referenced in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Result:** PASS

- `.env.example` ✓
- `torch-config.example.json` ✓
- `TORCH.md` ✓
- `docs/prompt-versioning.md` ✓
- `docs/removal.md` ✓
- `docs/lib-overview.md` ✓
- `docs/lock-ops-overview.md` ✓
- `src/lib.mjs` (referenced as main export in package.json) ✓
- `src/prompts/` ✓
- `skills/` ✓
- `dashboard/` ✓
- `src/prompts/roster.json` ✓
- `bin/torch-lock.mjs` (referenced as CLI bin) ✓

## Verification: env vars in codebase

**Method:** Used Grep on `src/torch-config.mjs` to verify the 4 env vars missing from README.md.

**Result:** PASS — all 4 confirmed used in `src/torch-config.mjs`:
- `NOSTR_LOCK_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT_MS` ✓
- `NOSTR_LOCK_MIN_SUCCESSFUL_PUBLISHES` ✓
- `NOSTR_LOCK_RELAY_FALLBACKS` ✓
- `NOSTR_LOCK_MIN_ACTIVE_RELAY_POOL` ✓

## Verification: README.md changes

**Method:** Inspected README.md after edits to confirm additions are accurate.

**Result:** PASS — all added content matches TORCH.md and src/torch-config.mjs.

## Environmental limitations

- `npm run lint` not executed (outbound WebSocket restricted in Claude Code environment — see KNOWN_ISSUES.md). Documentation-only changes; lint would verify JS syntax only, not markdown content.
- `npm test` not executed (sandbox restrictions — see KNOWN_ISSUES.md: `KNOWN-ISSUE-sandbox-eprem-tests`). No test changes made this run.
