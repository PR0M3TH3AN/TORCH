## Verification Steps

1. **Linting**
   - Command: `npm run lint`
   - Result: Passed (after fixing unused `relayListLabel` in `src/lock-publisher.mjs`).

   - Command: `npm test`
   - Result: Passed (294 tests).

3. **File Size Check**

   - Result: `src/lock-ops.mjs` is no longer in the report (meaning it is < 300 lines).
   - Previous Size: 881 lines.
   - New Size: < 300 lines.
   - Reduction: > 581 lines.
