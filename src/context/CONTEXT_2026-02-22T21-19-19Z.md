Goal: Migrate innerHTML usage in landing/index.html to safe DOM APIs.
Scope: landing/index.html
Constraints: Do not break functionality. Minimize changes.

Reason: Security hardening and reducing innerHTML count.
Date: 2026-02-22

Plan:
1. Replace container.innerHTML = '' with replaceChildren()
2. Replace container.innerHTML = Error... with createElement
3. Replace card.innerHTML = ... with createElement structure
4. Keep marked.parse usage as is (documented)
