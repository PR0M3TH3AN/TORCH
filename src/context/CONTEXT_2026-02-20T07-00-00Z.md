# Context — docs-code-investigator — 2026-02-20

## Selected target file

- **File:** `scripts/agent/run-scheduler-cycle.mjs`
- **Line count:** 926 lines
- **Reason for selection:**
  - Largest undocumented source file in the repo (existing overview docs cover only `src/lib.mjs`, `src/lock-ops.mjs`, `src/services/memory/index.js`).
  - Central orchestrator for all agent scheduling — highest maintenance risk.
  - Recent active commits with no corresponding documentation.
  - No `TODO/FIXME/XXX` but function-level complexity warrants JSDoc and a flow overview.
- **Last significant commits:**
  - `a5f08ff` feat(scheduler): add local time-window guard (recent)
  - `9278dad` Print final run summary in scheduler cycle
  - `ae2e382` Fix: Correctly detect agent platform for locks

## Plan

1. Add top-of-file flow comment (16-step outline per `src/prompts/scheduler-flow.md`).
2. Add JSDoc to all internal helper functions.
3. Add targeted inline comments where intent is non-obvious.
4. Produce `docs/scheduler-cycle-overview.md`.
5. Write run artifacts.

## Constraints

- Documentation only — no behavioral changes.
- No crypto code in this file; no security issue to open.
- Single file scope: only `scripts/agent/run-scheduler-cycle.mjs` modified.
- `npm run lint` and `npm test` not runnable in Claude Code sandbox (KNOWN-ISSUE-sandbox-eprem-tests).
