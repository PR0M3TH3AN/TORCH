# Context: Docs Agent Run 2026-02-18

The `docs-agent` was selected to audit and improve documentation.

## Goals
1. Audit `README.md` and other docs against the codebase.
2. Improve Quickstart instructions.
3. Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` if missing.

## Findings
- `AGENTS.md` is missing.
- `docs/event-schemas.md` and `docs/runtime-fallback.md` are missing.
- `package.json` lacks a `format` script.
- `README.md` lacked a clear development quickstart.

## Actions Taken
- Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with verified commands (`npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`).
- Updated `README.md` to link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and provide a quick start.
