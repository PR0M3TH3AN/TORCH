# Context - Prompt Safety Fixes

## Goal
Automatically remediate safety findings from `artifacts/prompt-safety-audit.md` as per the `prompt-fixer-agent` mission.

## Scope
- Read the audit report.
- Apply `FAILURE MODES` and `EXIT CRITERIA` (no-op logic) to flagged prompts.
- Do not modify core logic.

## Findings
- 24 agents were flagged as needing improvement.
- Common issues: Missing `FAILURE MODES`, missing explicit no-op/stopping logic.

## Constraints
- Must not break existing prompt structure.
- Must ensure safety sections are present.
