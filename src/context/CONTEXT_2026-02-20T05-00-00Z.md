# Context — docs-agent — 2026-02-20

## Goal

Audit key documentation files (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) for accuracy relative to the codebase and fix any inaccuracies found.

## Scope

- Baseline reads: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `docs/agent-handoffs/README.md`
- Audit targets: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Verify all scripts/commands against `package.json`
- Fix P1 inaccuracies (missing env vars, missing config keys)
- Write run artifacts in canonical paths

## Constraints

- Do not invent commands or APIs not verified in code
- Minimal edits — prefer targeted fixes over wholesale rewrites
- Do not change test behavior or policy intent in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md

## Open questions

- None. All referenced files found and verified.

## Findings

1. `README.md` environment variables section is missing 4 env vars present in `TORCH.md` and used in `src/torch-config.mjs`: `NOSTR_LOCK_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT_MS`, `NOSTR_LOCK_MIN_SUCCESSFUL_PUBLISHES`, `NOSTR_LOCK_RELAY_FALLBACKS`, `NOSTR_LOCK_MIN_ACTIVE_RELAY_POOL`.
2. `README.md` `torch-config.json` section is missing 8 config keys fully documented in `TORCH.md`: `publishTimeoutMs`, `minSuccessfulRelayPublishes`, `relayFallbacks`, `minActiveRelayPool`, `handoffCommandByCadence`, `strict_lock`, `degraded_lock_retry_window`, `max_deferrals`.
3. `CONTRIBUTING.md` — accurate; all commands verified against `package.json`. No issues found.
4. `AGENTS.md` — accurate; no broken paths or incorrect commands.
5. `.env.example`, `torch-config.example.json`, `docs/lib-overview.md`, `docs/lock-ops-overview.md`, `skills/`, `dashboard/` — all exist ✓
