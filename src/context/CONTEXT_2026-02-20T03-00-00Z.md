# Context: Docs Alignment - Script Updates

## Goal
Align `README.md` and `TORCH.md` documentation with the available scripts in `package.json`. Specifically, document the scheduler execution and lock completion scripts that are crucial for development and debugging.

## Scope
- `README.md`: "Development" / "NPM Scripts" section.
- `TORCH.md`: "NPM Scripts (for development)" section.

## Constraints
- Do not modify `package.json` scripts themselves.
- Ensure commands are accurate and match `package.json` definitions.
- Maintain existing document structure.

## Open Questions
- None.
