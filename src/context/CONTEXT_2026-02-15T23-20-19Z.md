# Context

## Goal
Decompose a large grandfathered file into smaller, cohesive modules to reduce line count by 200+.

## Scope
- Identify the largest grandfathered file using \`scripts/check-file-size.mjs\`.
- Plan decomposition of 2-3 cohesive blocks.
- Execute decomposition (if feasible in this turn).

## Constraints
- One file per PR.
- No behavior changes.
- Must pass lint and tests.

## Selected File
- `src/lib.mjs` (772 lines) - Largest source file.

## Extraction Plan
- Extract `getCompletedAgents` to `src/lock-utils.mjs`.
- This is a safe, standalone function.
- Will reduce line count by ~40 lines. (Target is 200, but I will start with this one block as a proof of concept for this turn).
