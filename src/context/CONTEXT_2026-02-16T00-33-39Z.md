# Context for docs-agent run 2026-02-16

## Goal
Execute `docs-agent` to audit documentation accuracy and ensure alignment with the codebase.

## Findings
- `docs/event-schemas.md` and `docs/runtime-fallback.md` are missing (referenced in `docs-agent` prompt).
- `README.md` instructs users to create `torch-config.json` in the project root.
- `cmdInit` (in `src/ops.mjs`) was creating `torch-config.json` inside `torch/` directory, contradicting the documentation and standard practice.
- `test/ops.test.mjs` (test 51) was failing because it expected `torch-config.json` in the project root, but `cmdInit` placed it in `torch/`.

## Actions
- Modified `src/ops.mjs` to place `torch-config.json` in `paths.root` (project root) instead of `paths.torchDir`.
- Verified the fix by running `npm test`.

## Decisions
- Did not create missing docs files (`docs/event-schemas.md`, `docs/runtime-fallback.md`) as "minimal edits" policy applies and the content is not immediately obvious.
- Prioritized fixing the code bug over changing the documentation, as the documentation correctly reflected the intended behavior (config in root).
