# Context

Executed prompt: src/prompts/daily/load-test-agent.md

## Goal
Execute a safe, reproducible load test against a local relay to measure baseline performance.

## Scope
- Create a local ephemeral relay for testing.
- Run the load test harness (`scripts/agent/load-test.mjs`) against the local relay.
- Generate a performance report.

## Constraints
- Must not target public relays.
- Must use `load-test-agent` prompt instructions.
- Must not introduce new dependencies if possible.
