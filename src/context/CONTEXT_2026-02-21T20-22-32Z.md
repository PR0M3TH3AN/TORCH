Goal
- Re-triage pending proposals, unresolved incidents/issues, and operational dead ends into a single prioritized implementation backlog.

Scope
- Inputs reviewed: `docs/proposals/*.md`, `docs/AGENT_COVERAGE_GAPS.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `task-logs/daily/`, `task-logs/weekly/`, `artifacts/`, `src/todo/`, `features/`, `docs/agent-handoffs/incidents/`, previous `src/backlog/BACKLOG.md`.

Constraints
- No implementation planning/build execution in this run.
- Preserve existing backlog IDs and classify by triage status only.
- Keep scheduler-owned completion/logging out of scope for this spawned agent run.

Issue handling
- No new reproducible issue was discovered during this triage pass.
- Existing unresolved issues remain tracked in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and corresponding incident notes; no updates were required in this run.
