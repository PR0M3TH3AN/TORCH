# Audit Context

## Goal
Audit the `/content` directory for user-facing documentation accuracy, specifically focusing on upload flows and contribution guidelines.

## Scope
- Directory: `/content` (if exists)
- Docs: Upload guides, contribution docs.
- Code: Related upload handlers and config.

## Constraints
- Do not invent APIs.
- Prefer docs changes over code changes.
- Exit without changes if no work is required (or if target is missing).
