# Context: Decompose src/lib.mjs

## Chosen File
`src/lib.mjs` (approx 700 lines).

## Reason for Selection
It is one of the largest grandfathered files (excluding HTML files which are harder to module-decompose). It contains mixed concerns: roster management, lock operations, and dashboard server logic.

## Extraction Plan
1. Extract roster logic to `src/roster.mjs`.
2. Extract lock operations to `src/lock-ops.mjs`.
3. Extract dashboard logic to `src/dashboard.mjs`.
4. Move configuration helpers to `src/torch-config.mjs` and constants to `src/constants.mjs`.

## Goal
Reduce `src/lib.mjs` by at least 200 lines while preserving behavior.
