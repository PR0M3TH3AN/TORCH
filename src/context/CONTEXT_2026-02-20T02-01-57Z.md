# Audit Context

## Goal
Validate user-facing upload/contribution docs under `docs/` against runtime behavior and update documentation if mismatched.

## Scope
- `docs/` pages with upload/contribution/media claims.
- Code paths that would implement those claims (`src/`, `api/`, `server/`, `js/` if present).

## Constraint Findings
- Repository contains no upload/contribution media implementation surface and no matching docs claims.
- This run is an evidence-backed no-op for product docs; only required scheduler artifacts and issue capture are updated.
