# Context

## Goal
Identify external protocol/spec dependencies used by this codebase, map them to implementation points, assess compliance risk, and propose the smallest safe improvements.

## Scope
- `PROTOCOL_INVENTORY.md`
- Codebase scan for protocol references

## Assumptions
- `grep` is sufficient for initial discovery of protocol references.

## Constraints
- Prefer incremental changes.
- Treat auth, cryptography, and trust boundaries as high risk.
