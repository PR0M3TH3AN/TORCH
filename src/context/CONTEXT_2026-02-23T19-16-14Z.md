# Context

## Goal
Execute the `protocol-research-agent` mission to identify external protocol/spec dependencies, map them to implementation points, assess compliance risk, and propose improvements.

## Scope
- Scan `src/` directory for protocol references (Nostr, WebSocket, HTTP).
- Update `PROTOCOL_INVENTORY.md`.
- Generate a protocol audit report.
- Verify compliance with identified NIPs.

## Constraints
- Do not modify core lock logic unless critical issues are found.
- Produce reproducible artifacts.
- Follow `src/prompts/daily/protocol-research-agent.md`.
