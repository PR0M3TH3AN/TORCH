# Context: InnerHTML Migration
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Agent:** innerhtml-migration-agent
**File:** `landing/index.html`

## Selection Reason
The file `landing/index.html` was selected because it has the highest number of `innerHTML` assignments (3) according to the report.

## Plan
1.  Analyze `innerHTML` usages in `landing/index.html`.
2.  Replace usage in `fetchDocs` (rendering Markdown) if possible, or document why it must remain (trusted source).
3.  Replace usage in `copyToClipboard` (restoring button state) with DOM manipulation.
4.  Verify changes.
