# Context

- Goal: Upgrade `scripts/agent/load-test.mjs` into a safe, reproducible relay load-test harness with strict anti-public guardrails, bounded concurrency/backpressure, and actionable reporting.
- Scope: Load harness + generated load report artifacts + scheduler required run artifacts.
- Constraints: Never target known public relays; require explicit relay URL; support dry-run; avoid root clutter.
- Baseline reviewed: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TORCH.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `docs/agent-handoffs/README.md`, `src/prompts/scheduler-flow.md`, recent learning/incident notes.
