# Context

## Goal
Audit documentation for accuracy and alignment with the codebase.

## Scope
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/` directory

## Constraints
- Do not modify implementation code.
- Only update docs that are verifiably incorrect.

## Findings
- `README.md` commands for installation and development are accurate based on `package.json`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` correctly lists testing commands (`npm test`, `npm run test:unit:lock-backend`).
- `npm run format` and `npm run test:unit` (mentioned in agent prompt as targets) do not exist in `package.json`, so they are not documented.
- `docs/lib-overview.md` and `docs/lock-ops-overview.md` exist as referenced.

## Current State
Documentation appears up-to-date with the current codebase state.
