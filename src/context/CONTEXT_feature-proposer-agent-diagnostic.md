# Context: Diagnostic Utility Script

## Goal
Create a standalone diagnostic utility to help users verify their local TORCH environment.

## Scope
- Implement `features/diagnostic.mjs`.
- Checks for Node version, dependencies, config, file system, git, and connectivity.
- No new dependencies.

## Constraints
- Single file implementation.
- Must not modify existing files (except for adding the new feature).
