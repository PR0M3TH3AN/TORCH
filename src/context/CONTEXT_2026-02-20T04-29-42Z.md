Goal: run daily KNOWN_ISSUES remediation loop and refresh issue accuracy with reproducible evidence.
Scope: KNOWN_ISSUES triage, incident capture, daily known-issues report, and required run artifacts.
Constraints: no risky test weakening, no lock completion publish, no final task-log completion files.
Open questions:
- Should environment-restricted test failures be moved behind explicit environment guards in a future refactor?
