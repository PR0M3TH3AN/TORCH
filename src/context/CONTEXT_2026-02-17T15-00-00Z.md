# Context - Feature Proposer Agent Run

**Agent**: feature-proposer-agent
**Cadence**: weekly
**Run-Start**: 2026-02-17T15:00:00Z
**Prompt-Path**: src/prompts/weekly/feature-proposer-agent.md

## Goal
Implement a new feature to improve developer experience.

## Scope
Create a new feature in `features/` directory.

## Constraints
Single file, no new dependencies.

## Analysis
- The repository has a `task-logs/` directory with daily and weekly logs.
- Checking these logs manually is tedious.
- A simple CLI tool to summarize these logs would be high-value and low-risk.
- Prompt file: `src/prompts/weekly/feature-proposer-agent.md`.

## Selected Feature
- `features/log-summary.mjs`: A Node.js script to parse and display a summary of recent agent runs.

## Implementation Details
- Uses `fs` and `path` modules.
- Scans `task-logs/daily` and `task-logs/weekly`.
- Parses filenames `<timestamp>__<agent>__<status>.md`.
- Outputs a formatted ASCII table.
