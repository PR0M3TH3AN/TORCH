# Context — docs-alignment-agent — 2026-02-20

## Goal

Verify, correct, and validate that development documentation matches codebase reality (daily diff-driven pass). Trace concrete doc claims to code and fix confirmed mismatches.

## Scope

- Audit targets: `docs/lib-overview.md`, `docs/lock-ops-overview.md`, `docs/memory-index-overview.md`, `docs/removal.md`, `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`, `docs/AGENT_COVERAGE_GAPS.md`, `src/constants.mjs` (USAGE_TEXT)
- Verify each claim by tracing to `src/` code
- Fix P1 (incorrect) and P2 (incomplete) issues in targeted docs
- Write claims map, diagnosis, and validation notes

## Constraints

- No inventing behavior — trace every claim to code
- Minimal edits only
- Constants USAGE_TEXT fix is a doc string in source code — small, safe, and a clear correctness fix

## Open questions

- None. All relevant source files found and inspected.
