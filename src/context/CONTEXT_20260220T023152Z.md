## Goal
Document one complex source file with behavior-focused comments/JSDoc and a companion overview doc without changing runtime behavior.

## Target Selection
- **Selected file:** `src/services/memory/index.js`
- **Line count:** 466 lines
- **Selection reason:** Core memory orchestration module with multiple exported entrypoints used by CLI and scheduler memory workflows; high complexity and stateful behavior (cache, persistence, pruning, telemetry).
- **Candidate evidence:** Top large-file scan showed this file in the top 10 and specifically in memory core paths.
- **Last significant commit touching file:** `c123dd9a7702fed425a96fc11517b0bac38925ca` (2026-02-18) — `perf: make saveMemoryStore async and non-blocking`.

## Baseline Reads Completed
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `TORCH.md`
- `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- `docs/agent-handoffs/README.md`
- Recent handoff notes in `docs/agent-handoffs/learnings/` and `docs/agent-handoffs/incidents/`.
- Scheduler contract in `src/prompts/scheduler-flow.md`.

## Memory Contract Evidence (Pre-implementation)
- Retrieval command executed with scheduler env:
  - `SCHEDULER_CADENCE=daily`
  - `SCHEDULER_AGENT=docs-code-investigator`
  - `SCHEDULER_RUN_ID=docs-code-investigator-20260220T023152Z`
- Marker observed: `MEMORY_RETRIEVED`
- Artifacts observed:
  - `.scheduler-memory/docs-code-investigator-20260220T023152Z/retrieve.json`
  - `.scheduler-memory/latest/daily/retrieve.ok`
  - `.scheduler-memory/latest/daily/memories.md`

## Constraints
- Documentation-only changes for a single source file and optional overview doc.
- No behavior changes.
- No crypto/signing logic modifications.
- Scheduler-owned completion files and `lock:complete` are out of scope for spawned agent runs.
