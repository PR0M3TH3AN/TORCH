# Context for Decomposition of src/lib.mjs

## File Selection
- **File**: `src/lib.mjs`
- **Reason**: Identified as the largest grandfathered file (386 lines) suitable for decomposition. `landing/index.html` and `dashboard/index.html` were larger but are not JS source files.
- **Node Version**: v22.22.0
- **Extraction Plan**:
  - Extract `cmdCheck` to `src/cmd-check.mjs`
  - Extract `cmdLock` to `src/cmd-lock.mjs`
  - Extract `cmdList` to `src/cmd-list.mjs`
  - Extract `ExitError` to `src/errors.mjs`
  - Extract utilities to `src/utils.mjs`

## Goal
Reduce `src/lib.mjs` size by > 200 lines while preserving behavior.
