# Context: perf-agent (2026-02-16)

## Goal
Improve app responsiveness by finding and fixing background CPU/network work.

## Scope
- Focus on "Visibility gating" for `dashboard/index.html`.
- Run grep searches for performance patterns.
- Ensure `INITIAL_BASELINE.md` exists.

## Constraints
- Minimal changes.
- Safe changes only.
- No network access to external sites.
- Running as a simulated agent (Jules).

## Assumptions
- `dashboard/index.html` is the primary entry point for the dashboard.
- `setInterval` in `dashboard/index.html` runs even when tab is hidden, wasting CPU.
