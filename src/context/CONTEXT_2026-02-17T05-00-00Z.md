# Context: Test Audit Run 2026-02-17

## Goal
Run daily audits of the test suite to verify tests actually test the behaviors they claim to, find fragile or missing tests, and propose small, high-confidence fixes.

## Scope
- Run full test suite with coverage.
- Detect flakiness.
- Static analysis of test files.
- Generate audit report.

## Constraints
- Do not modify production code solely to satisfy tests.
- Keep CI green.
