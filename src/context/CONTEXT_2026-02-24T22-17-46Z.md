# Context

## Goal
Clean up stale log files and memory updates older than 14 days to keep the repository tidy.

## Scope
-   Log files (`*.log`, `*.log.*`, `*.out.log`) in the repository root.
-   Memory updates (`memory-updates/*.md`) in the repository root.
-   Files older than 14 days.

## Constraints
-   Do not delete files outside the repository root.
-   Do not delete non-log/non-memory files.
-   Do not broaden scope if deletion fails.
