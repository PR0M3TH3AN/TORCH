# Context Note — Content Audit — 2026-02-21

## Goal
Verify documentation accuracy against repository implementation.

## Scope
- `README.md`
- `TORCH.md`
- `bin/torch-lock.mjs`
- `src/constants.mjs`

## Findings
- `USAGE_TEXT` in `src/constants.mjs` was missing `proposal`, `rollback`, and `backup` commands, despite them being implemented and documented.
- `README.md` correctly lists these commands.
- `npm run validate:docs` passed.

## Constraints
- Limited to correcting specific inaccuracies.
