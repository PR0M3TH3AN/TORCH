## Plan
1.  **Target**: `src/lib.mjs` (Core logic, ~700 LOC).
2.  **Goal**: Add JSDoc and flow comments to clarify locking, checking, and completion logic.
3.  **Rationale**: This file orchestrates the entire Torch system but lacks detailed documentation for its exported functions.
4.  **Artifacts**:
    *   Inline JSDoc in `src/lib.mjs`.
    *   `docs/lib-overview.md` for high-level documentation.
