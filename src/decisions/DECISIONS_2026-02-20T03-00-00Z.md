# Decisions: Docs Alignment - Script Updates

## Decision 1: Document `scheduler:*` scripts
**Decision:** Add `npm run scheduler:daily` and `npm run scheduler:weekly` to the developer documentation.
**Rationale:** These scripts are defined in `package.json` and are critical for testing the full scheduler cycle locally. Their absence makes it harder for contributors to verify changes to the scheduler logic.
**Alternatives:** Leave them undocumented (relies on users reading `package.json`). Rejected as it hurts discoverability.

## Decision 2: Document `lock:complete` script
**Decision:** Add `npm run lock:complete` to the developer documentation.
**Rationale:** This script is essential for manually releasing locks during development or debugging.
**Consequences:** Developers will have better visibility into lock management tools.
