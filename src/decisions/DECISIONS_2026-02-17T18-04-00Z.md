# Decisions

<!--
Agent: audit-agent
Cadence: daily

## Decision
Manual execution of audit steps from `src/prompts/daily/audit-agent.md`.

## Rationale
The agent runner script `run-selected-prompt.mjs` defaults to a simulated execution on Linux. To fulfill the agent's duties, I am manually executing the defined workflow.
