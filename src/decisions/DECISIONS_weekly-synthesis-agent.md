# Decisions: Weekly Synthesis Agent

- **Decision 1:** Used `git log --all` to ensure all agent branches are captured, as `git log` on the current branch showed limited history.
- **Decision 2:** Prioritized failures in `task-logs` for the "Recommended Human Actions" section.
- **Decision 3:** Highlighted the refactoring of `src/lib.mjs` as a major theme due to the high volume of related commits.
