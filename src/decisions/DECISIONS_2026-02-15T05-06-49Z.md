# Decisions - Prompt Safety Fixes

## Decision: Automation Strategy
- Used a Python script (`fix_prompts.py`) to parse the audit report and apply fixes.
- This ensures consistency and reduces manual error for 24 files.

## Rationale
- **Failure Modes**: Appended to the end of the file (or before `OUTPUTS` if present).
- **No-op Logic**: Inserted into `MISSION`, `WORKFLOW`, or `GOALS` sections. The script looks for these headers and inserts the line `- If no work is required, exit without making changes.` at the end of the section (before the next header).

## Manual Intervention
- `protocol-research-agent.md` required manual intervention because the script failed to identify a suitable insertion point with the initial logic (though updated logic might have worked, manual fix was safer and faster).

## Verification
- Verified that `const-refactor-agent.md` contains the new sections.
- Verified that `protocol-research-agent.md` contains the new no-op logic.
