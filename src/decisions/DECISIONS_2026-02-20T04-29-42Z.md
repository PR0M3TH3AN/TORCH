Decision: avoid direct code/test changes for remaining active failures in this run.
Alternatives considered:
- Patch tests to avoid stdio assertions and local bind operations in sandbox-only runs.
- Add environment conditionals around sandbox-restricted tests.
Rationale:
- Current failures are either environment restrictions (EPERM on listen/shell spawn) or medium-scope harness behavior requiring broader design review.
- Daily remediation objective is accuracy + safe progress; documentation/incident updates are the smallest safe action.
Consequences/follow-ups:
- Active issues remain documented with fresh repro evidence and clear workarounds.
- Future run from a less restricted environment should open/update GitHub issues for medium-scope remediation.
