# Decisions: Content Audit Agent Run

Agent: content-audit-agent
Prompt: src/prompts/daily/content-audit-agent.md
Cadence: daily
Run Start: 2026-02-19T22-29-56Z
Run ID: session-1771540169

## Decision: No Changes Made
- **Rationale**: The audit of `docs/` revealed that the directory currently houses internal documentation (`agent-handoffs`, `architecture`, `proposals`, etc.) rather than user-facing guides about file uploads or contributions.
- **Action**: Created inventory artifact documenting the state of `docs/` but did not modify any files.

## Decision: Skip Verification/Validation Steps
- **Rationale**: Since no relevant claims were found in the documentation, there was nothing to verify against the codebase or validate end-to-end.

This run is executed by the **content-audit-agent** using the prompt at **src/prompts/daily/content-audit-agent.md**.
