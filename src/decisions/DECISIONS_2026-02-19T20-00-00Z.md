# Decisions — audit-agent run 2026-02-19T20:00:00Z

## Decision: Use --report flag for all audit scripts
- **Alternatives considered**: Running without flags (may modify files)
- **Rationale**: Prompt specifies report mode; job is read-only
- **Consequences**: No source file changes; outputs are logs/reports only

## Decision: Parse raw logs inline (no separate parser scripts)
- **Alternatives considered**: Writing separate parser scripts per audit script
- **Rationale**: Parser scripts may not exist in this repo; inline parsing is more reproducible
- **Consequences**: Parse logic recorded in test log for reproducibility

## Decision: Post results as new GitHub issue if no existing audit issue found
- **Alternatives considered**: Silently skip GitHub posting
- **Rationale**: Prompt requires publishing results; issue creation is non-destructive
- **Consequences**: Creates `Audit Report — 2026-02-19` issue with label `audit-report`

## Assumption: grandfathered file tracking
- No prior audit reports found in the TORCH repo; this is treated as the first run.
- All oversized files are reported as-is without grandfathered classification.
