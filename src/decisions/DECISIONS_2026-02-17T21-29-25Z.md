# Decisions

## Decision: Report missing content directory
- **Rationale**: The agent is tasked with auditing `/content`, but the directory does not exist in the repository root. This is likely a configuration error or the content is located elsewhere (e.g., `src/docs`, but the prompt specifically targets `/content`). The decision is to report this as a Known Issue and not attempt to audit unrelated directories to avoid incorrect assumptions.
