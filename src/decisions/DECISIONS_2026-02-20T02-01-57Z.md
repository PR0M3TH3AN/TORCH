# Decisions

## Decision 1: Keep product docs unchanged
- Rationale: No upload/contribution-media behavior or docs claims exist to align.
- Alternatives considered: Editing unrelated docs to satisfy prompt shape.
- Why rejected: Would introduce non-truthful documentation and violate scenario-first integrity.

## Decision 2: Record a scope-mismatch issue
- Rationale: Prompt mission is reproducibly mis-scoped relative to repository functionality.
- Outcome: Added active issue entry plus incident note for scheduler/prompt maintainers.
