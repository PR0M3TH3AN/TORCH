# Decisions

Executed prompt: `src/prompts/daily/protocol-research-agent.md`

## Decision: No core logic changes required

**Rationale**: The scan confirmed that existing protocol implementations (Nostr NIP-01/33/40/78, WebSocket, HTTP) are compliant and safe. The explicit omission of the expiration tag in `cmd-complete.mjs` is intentional for permanent storage and does not violate protocol expectations for this use case. No risky behavior was found requiring immediate remediation.
