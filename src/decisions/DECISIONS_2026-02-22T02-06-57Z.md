# Decisions

## Decision
- Maintained current `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` content.

## Rationale
- The commands listed in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` match the available scripts in `package.json`.
- Adding `npm run format` or `npm run test:unit` as suggested by the prompt would require adding those scripts to `package.json`, which is out of scope for a docs-only update unless strictly necessary.
- Existing commands (`npm test`, `npm run lint`) cover the verification needs.
