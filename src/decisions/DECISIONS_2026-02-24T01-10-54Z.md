# Decisions

Executed prompt: src/prompts/daily/perf-agent.md

## Decision: Debounce renderLocks in dashboard/app.js
**Rationale:** The `renderLocks` function is called synchronously on every WebSocket message. During high traffic or initial load, this can freeze the UI. Using `requestAnimationFrame` and checking `document.hidden` ensures we only render when necessary and efficient.
