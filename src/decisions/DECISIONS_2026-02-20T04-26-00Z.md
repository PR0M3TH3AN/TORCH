# Decisions — log-fixer-agent Daily Run

## Decision 1: Skip lock backend error failures

**Decision:** Do not attempt to fix `decompose-agent` (2026-02-20) or `perf-optimization-agent` (2026-02-19) lock failures.

**Rationale:** Both failures are classified as `lock_backend_error` / `relay_publish_non_retryable`. Per prompt constraints: "Do not attempt to fix 'Lock backend error' or transient network issues; these should just be noted." These are relay connectivity failures that cannot be fixed in code.

**Alternatives considered:** N/A — explicit prohibition in prompt.

**Consequences/follow-ups:** None required. These failures self-resolve when relay connectivity recovers.

## Decision 2: Document pr-review-agent artifact failure as incident

**Decision:** Write incident note for pr-review-agent verify failure; do not create a code PR since no source code is broken.

**Rationale:** The `pr-review-agent` failed because `verify-run-artifacts.mjs` returned exit 1 — the agent (linux platform) did not write required run artifacts with the correct metadata fields (`agent:`, `cadence:`, `run-start:`). The verify script and prompt are correct; the agent simply did not follow the artifact format. An incident note documents the pattern and recommendations for future runs.

**Alternatives considered:** Open a GitHub issue or PR to add explicit metadata format instructions to the pr-review-agent prompt. Deferred since prompt-maintenance-agent ran successfully on 2026-02-19 and may have already addressed this.

**Consequences/follow-ups:** Check if prompt-maintenance-agent updated the pr-review-agent prompt to include artifact metadata instructions.
