Decision
- Reclassify the implementation backlog to prioritize direct unblockers first (format script, missing event schema module, content-audit scope correction, prompt graph extraction, scheduler platform assertion alignment), while deferring lower-impact agent additions and upstream-only external defects.

Rationale
- Current highest-friction failures are deterministic and local to this repository (`npm run format` absent, missing `src/lib/eventSchemas.js`, scheduler preflight platform mismatch).
- Coverage-gap proposals with lower immediate operational impact (`skills-agent`, `landing-page-agent`) should remain deferred.
- Goose wrapper ETXTBSY/exit-code defects are external to this repository and should be retired from implementation backlog while remaining tracked as operational known issues.

Scoring notes (weighted: Unblock*3 + Value*2 + Scope*1 - Risk*1)
- BACKLOG-001 `npm run format`: score 14 (high unblock, low risk) -> `ready-to-plan`
- BACKLOG-002 `src/lib/eventSchemas.js`: score 13 (high unblock, bounded scope) -> `ready-to-plan`
- BACKLOG-012 scheduler platform assertion alignment: score 12 (high validation unblock) -> `ready-to-plan`
- BACKLOG-013 memory telemetry capture stabilization: score 8 (valuable but implementation uncertain) -> `needs-scoping`
- BACKLOG-016/017/018 new low-priority agent additions: score <=5 -> `deferred`

Alternatives considered
- Keep prior backlog unchanged: rejected because it omitted active known-issue backlog items and several coverage-gap entries.
- Promote all coverage-gap agents to `needs-scoping`: rejected to avoid priority dilution and preserve execution focus for plan/builder.

Consequences
- Plan-agent now has a tighter set of P1 items aligned to active failures.
- Deferred queue remains visible without blocking higher-value remediation.
