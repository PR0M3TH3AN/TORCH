# Decision
Execute tests in Jules environment.

# Rationale
Jules is the current execution platform. While some issues are specific to "Sandbox" (Codex/Claude), verifying behavior in Jules provides a baseline and confirms if issues are environment-agnostic or specific.

# Decision
Do not attempt to fix "Sandbox" issues in Jules.

# Rationale
Since Jules likely does not suffer from the same restrictions (e.g., EPERM on sockets), a fix cannot be verified here. We will mark them as "Verified: Does not reproduce in Jules".
