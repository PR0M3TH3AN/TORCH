# Decisions - 20260220T023152Z

## Decision 1: Select `src/services/memory/index.js`
- **Decision:** Document `src/services/memory/index.js` only.
- **Alternatives considered:** `dashboard/app.js`, `src/lib.mjs`, `scripts/agent/run-scheduler-cycle.mjs`.
- **Rationale:** `src/services/memory/index.js` is a high-impact module with multiple exports and side effects (persistent store, prune lifecycle, telemetry, cache behavior), making documentation yield high maintenance value.
- **Consequence:** Keep PR narrowly scoped to one source file plus one overview doc.

## Decision 2: Keep edits documentation-only
- **Decision:** Only comments/JSDoc + external overview doc; no logic changes.
- **Rationale:** Mission requires non-invasive documentation and prohibits behavioral changes.
- **Consequence:** Any discovered correctness/security concerns will be documented, not fixed in this run.

## Decision 3: Omit scheduler-owned completion publishing
- **Decision:** Do not run `npm run lock:complete` and do not write `task-logs/...__completed.md|__failed.md`.
- **Rationale:** Shared scheduler contract assigns completion publish/logging to scheduler, not spawned agent.
- **Consequence:** Return artifacts and results to scheduler/user only.

## Decision 4: Omit `git pull --ff-only`
- **Decision:** Do not execute remote pull step from first-run checklist.
- **Rationale:** Environment has restricted network access and this run does not require branch sync for local documentation edits.
- **Consequence:** Proceed against current workspace state and report this omission explicitly.

## Decision 5: Capture unresolved validation failures as incidents (no test edits)
- **Decision:** Record reproducible test failures in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and `docs/agent-handoffs/incidents/` instead of changing tests.
- **Rationale:** Failures are environment-sensitive and outside scope of this documentation-only run; anti-cheat policy forbids weakening tests for green CI.
- **Consequence:** Preserve test integrity and provide actionable context for dedicated follow-up remediation.
