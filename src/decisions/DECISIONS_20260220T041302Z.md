# Decisions (20260220T041302Z)

## 1) Keep roster unchanged
- Reason: no orphan prompt files and no missing roster members were found.

## 2) Rewrite stale prompts instead of piecemeal edits
- Reason: `content-audit-agent` and `smoke-agent` had mission-level drift tied to non-existent product surfaces/paths.
- Action: replaced with repo-valid scope and command guidance.

## 3) Normalize verification commands in `pr-review-agent`
- Reason: prior prompt referenced non-existent script names (`format`, `test:unit`).
- Action: constrained to scripts present in `package.json` and explicit preflight verification.

## 4) Resolve known issue for content-audit mission drift
- Reason: prompt root-cause corrected in this run.
