# 2026-02-19T21-26-08Z: Extracted MS_PER_SECOND

## Decision
Extracted `1000` (milliseconds per second) to `MS_PER_SECOND` constant in `src/constants.mjs`.

## Rationale
- Multiple files (`src/relay-health.mjs`, `src/utils.mjs`, `src/lib.mjs`, `src/lock-ops.mjs`) were using the literal `1000` for time conversion.
- Using a named constant improves readability and maintainability.
- Reduces risk of "magic number" confusion.

## Alternatives Considered
- Leaving as literal (rejected: hard to search/replace if logic changes, less semantic).
