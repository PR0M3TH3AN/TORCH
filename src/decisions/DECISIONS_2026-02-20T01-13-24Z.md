## Decision: Defer Upgrades
- **Rationale:** The identified High severity vulnerability (`minimatch`) is a transitive dependency of `eslint`. Automatic upgrading of transitive dependencies is disabled to prevent instability. `npm outdated` shows `eslint` is up to date with the registry for the specified range.
- **Action:** Logged as pending task for manual review or future automated check when `eslint` updates.

## Decision: No Safe Upgrades Available
- **Rationale:** `npm outdated` returned no results, indicating all direct dependencies are at their latest satisfying versions.
