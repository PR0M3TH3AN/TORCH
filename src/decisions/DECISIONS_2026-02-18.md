# Decisions: Docs Agent Run 2026-02-18

## 1. Create CONTRIBUTING.md
**Decision:** Create a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
**Context:** The file was missing, and the agent prompt required it.
**Rationale:** It provides a central place for development instructions, improving onboarding.

## 2. Update README.md
**Decision:** Add a "Development" section to `README.md`.
**Context:** `README.md` focused on usage, not contribution.
**Rationale:** To make it easier for new contributors to get started and find the full contributing guide.
