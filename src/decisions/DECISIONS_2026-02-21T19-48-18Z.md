Decision
- Refactor `scripts/test-audit/run-flaky-check.mjs` to parse TAP reporter files per run and fail closed when zero outcomes are observed.

Rationale
- Piped child-process output is environment-sensitive and produced empty matrices in this run.
- A truthful flakiness audit must not report success when no evidence was captured.

Alternatives considered
- Keep stdout parsing and parse stderr too: still vulnerable to no-output child-process environments.
- Loosen checks and allow empty matrices: rejected as anti-cheat regression.

Consequence
- Flaky-check now exposes missing signal as a failing audit outcome.
- Added dedicated regression test with deterministic pass/fail fixtures.
