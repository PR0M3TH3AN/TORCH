# Decisions

Executing prompt: `src/prompts/daily/docs-agent.md`

## Decision 1: Remove stale audit targets
- **Rationale**: The docs-agent prompt lists `docs/event-schemas.md` and `docs/runtime-fallback.md` as audit targets, but these files do not exist and are not referenced in the codebase (README.md, AGENTS.md).
- **Outcome**: Removed these targets from `src/prompts/daily/docs-agent.md` to prevent future confusion.
