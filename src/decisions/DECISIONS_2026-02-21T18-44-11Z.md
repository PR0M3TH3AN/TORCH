# Decision Note — Content Audit — 2026-02-21

## Update `src/constants.mjs` Usage Text
**Decision:** Add `proposal`, `rollback`, and `backup` commands to `USAGE_TEXT`.
**Rationale:** The implementation exists in `src/lib.mjs` and commands are documented in `README.md`. The CLI help text was incomplete, leading to potential user confusion.
