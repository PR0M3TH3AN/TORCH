# Decisions

## Decision
Extracted `cmdRemove` to `src/cmd-remove.mjs`.

## Rationale
To adhere to separation of concerns and reduce the size of `src/ops.mjs` (>800 LOC).

## Decision
Restored explicit definition of `mergeRelayList` in `src/lock-utils.mjs` and removed it from re-export list.

## Rationale
To resolve `SyntaxError: The requested module './lock-utils.mjs' does not provide an export named 'mergeRelayList'` observed in CI.
