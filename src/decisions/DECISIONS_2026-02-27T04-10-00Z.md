# Decisions: docs-agent

- **Added `npm run format` to docs**: It is a critical developer workflow step defined in `package.json` but missing from top-level docs.
- **Fixed `test/scheduler-preflight-lock.e2e.test.mjs`**: The test was failing in CI because `src/torch-config.mjs` was not being copied to the test fixture. I added the copy step to ensure the test passes and the scheduler workflow can proceed.
