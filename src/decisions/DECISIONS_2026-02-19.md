# Protocol Decisions - 2026-02-19

## Decision: No updates to PROTOCOL_INVENTORY.md
**Rationale:** The current `PROTOCOL_INVENTORY.md` accurately reflects the codebase. References to NIP-01, NIP-33, NIP-40, and NIP-78 are present and compliant. NIP-42 is explicitly marked as not implemented, which aligns with the current code state.

## Decision: Generate Report Only
**Rationale:** No compliance gaps or high-risk areas were identified that require immediate remediation or new tests.
