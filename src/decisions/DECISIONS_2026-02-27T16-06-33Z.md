# Decisions — Weekly Synthesis Agent

- agent: weekly-synthesis-agent
- cadence: weekly
- run-start: 2026-02-27T16:06:33Z
- prompt-path: src/prompts/weekly/weekly-synthesis-agent.md

## Decision: Use Git Log and Task Logs
- **Rationale**: Git log provides the most reliable source of truth for code changes (PRs/merges), while task logs offer insight into agent execution status (success/failure) which might not result in a commit.
- **Alternatives**: GitHub API (not available in this environment/constraint set).

## Decision: Report Format
- **Rationale**: Follow the established format in `src/prompts/weekly/weekly-synthesis-agent.md` to ensure consistency and readability.
