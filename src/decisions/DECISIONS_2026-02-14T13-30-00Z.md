# Decisions for src/lib.mjs Decomposition

## Module Boundaries
- `cmdCheck`, `cmdLock`, and `cmdList` are distinct commands with their own dependencies and logic. They were extracted to separate files to improve modularity and reduce `lib.mjs` size.
- `ExitError` is used across multiple modules, so it was extracted to a shared `src/errors.mjs`.
- `todayDateStr` and `nowUnix` are generic utilities used across commands, extracted to `src/utils.mjs`.

## Re-exports
- `src/lib.mjs` re-exports the extracted commands (`cmdCheck`, `cmdLock`, `cmdList`) to maintain backward compatibility for any consumers using it as a library.

## File Size
- `src/lib.mjs` was reduced significantly by moving the command implementations out.
