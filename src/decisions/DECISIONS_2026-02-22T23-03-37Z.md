# Decisions

Executed prompt: src/prompts/daily/load-test-agent.md

## Decision
Use a local ephemeral WebSocket server as the relay target.

## Rationale
To ensure safety and avoid hitting public relays, as strictly required by the `load-test-agent` prompt and `AGENTS.md`. A local relay provides a controlled environment for measuring baseline harness performance.
