# Decisions

## Decision 1: Allow inline style in `app.js`
- Rationale: The `bar.style.width` calculation for the progress bar is highly dynamic (calculated from `ttlPct`). While it could use a CSS variable, the current implementation is simple and safe.
- Outcome: Noted in report as allowed.

## Decision 2: Replace `#fff` with `var(--text-strong)`
- Rationale: `#fff` is identical to the `text-strong` token value. Using the token ensures consistency.

## Decision 3: Fix `text-accent-strong` mapping
- Rationale: It was incorrectly using `var(--accent)` instead of `var(--accent-strong)`.
