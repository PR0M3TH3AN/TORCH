# Decisions - Docs Code Investigator - 2026-02-22

Executed prompt: `src/prompts/daily/docs-code-investigator.md`

## Decision 1: Document `src/ops.mjs`
- **Context:** `src/ops.mjs` is a large file (567 LOC) handling critical CLI operations (`init`, `update`) but lacked comprehensive JSDoc.
- **Decision:** Selected `src/ops.mjs` for documentation.
- **Rationale:** High-value target for improving maintainability and understanding of the deployment/update process.
- **Alternatives:** `src/services/memory/index.js` was also a candidate but `ops.mjs` seemed more central to current operations.
