# Decisions

## Decision: File Selection Strategy
Rationale: Following prompt instructions to use `scripts/check-file-size.mjs`.

## Decision: Artifact Creation
Rationale: Created standard artifacts to comply with scheduler requirements.

## Decision: Skip Baseline Update
Rationale: The script `scripts/check-file-size.mjs` does not support `--update` or contain a `BASELINE` object as described in the prompt. The prompt seems outdated. Proceeding without baseline update.
