# Decisions: Decompose src/lib.mjs

- Prompt: src/prompts/daily/decompose-agent.md

## Decision
Extract `cmdCheck`, `cmdList`, and `cmdComplete` into separate modules.

## Rationale
These are distinct, cohesive command implementations that can be cleanly separated from the main entry point to reduce file size and improve maintainability. `src/lib.mjs` was over 700 lines.

## Naming
- `src/cmd-check.mjs`: Specific to check command.
- `src/cmd-list.mjs`: Specific to list command.
- `src/cmd-complete.mjs`: Specific to complete command.

## Baseline Update
- Reduced `src/lib.mjs` from 730 lines to 438 lines (292 lines reduced).
- `scripts/check-file-size.mjs` does not support programmatic baseline updates or contain a `BASELINE` object, so manual update of the script was not possible/needed.
