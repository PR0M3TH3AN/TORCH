# Scheduler Flow (Single Source of Truth)

Use this document for all scheduler runs.


## Canonical artifact paths

All daily/weekly prompt files must reference run artifacts using these canonical directories:

- `src/context/CONTEXT_<timestamp>.md`
- `src/todo/TODO_<timestamp>.md`
- `src/decisions/DECISIONS_<timestamp>.md`
- `src/test_logs/TEST_LOG_<timestamp>.md`

Prompt authors: do not use legacy unprefixed paths (`context/`, `todo/`, `decisions/`, `test_logs/`).


## Shared Agent Run Contract (Required for All Spawned Agents)

Every agent prompt invoked by the schedulers (daily/weekly) MUST enforce this contract:

1. **Read baseline policy files before implementation**:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
   - Canonical path note: active issues are tracked in root `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (not `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`)
   - `docs/agent-handoffs/README.md`
   - Recent notes in `docs/agent-handoffs/learnings/` and `docs/agent-handoffs/incidents/`
2. **Update run artifacts** in `src/context/`, `src/todo/`, `src/decisions/`, and `src/test_logs/` during the run, or explicitly document why each artifact update is not needed for that run.
3. **Capture reusable failures and unresolved issues**:
   - Record reusable failures in `docs/agent-handoffs/incidents/`
   - Record active unresolved reproducible items in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
4. **Execute memory retrieval before implementation begins**:
   - Run configured memory retrieval workflow before prompt execution (for example via `scheduler.memoryPolicyByCadence.<cadence>.retrieveCommand`)
   - Retrieval command MUST call real memory services (`src/services/memory/index.js#getRelevantMemories` with `ingestEvents` seeding) and MUST emit deterministic marker `MEMORY_RETRIEVED`.
   - Retrieval command MUST write cadence-scoped evidence artifacts:
     - `.scheduler-memory/retrieve-<cadence>.ok`
     - `.scheduler-memory/retrieve-<cadence>.json` containing operation inputs/outputs (`agentId`, `query`, seeded event count, ingested count, retrieved count).
5. **Store memory after implementation and before completion publish**:
   - Run configured memory storage workflow after prompt execution (for example via `scheduler.memoryPolicyByCadence.<cadence>.storeCommand`)
   - Storage command MUST call real memory services (`src/services/memory/index.js#ingestEvents`, which uses ingestor/summarizer pipeline) and MUST emit deterministic marker `MEMORY_STORED`.
   - Storage command MUST write cadence-scoped evidence artifacts:
     - `.scheduler-memory/store-<cadence>.ok`
     - `.scheduler-memory/store-<cadence>.json` containing operation inputs/outputs (`agentId`, input event count, stored count, generated summaries).
6. **Scheduler-owned completion/logging is mandatory**:
   - Spawned agents MUST NOT run `lock:complete`.
   - Spawned agents MUST NOT write final `task-logs/<cadence>/<timestamp>__<agent-name>__completed.md` or `__failed.md` files.
   - Scheduler performs completion publish and writes final success/failure task logs after its own validation gates.

## Numbered MUST Procedure

1. Set cadence variables before any command:
   - `cadence` = `daily` or `weekly`
   - `log_dir` = `task-logs/<cadence>/`
   - `prompt_dir` = `src/prompts/<cadence>/`

   Note: branch naming (for example `agents/<cadence>/`) is orchestration-level behavior and is not used by `run-scheduler-cycle.mjs`.

2. Run preflight to build the exclusion set:

   ```bash
   if daily: `npm run lock:check:daily -- --json --quiet`; if weekly: `npm run lock:check:weekly -- --json --quiet`
   ```

   Canonical exclusion rule:
   - Use `excluded` from the `npm run lock:check:<cadence>` JSON output.
   - If `excluded` is unavailable, fallback to the union of `locked`, `paused`, and `completed` from that same JSON payload.

   Goose Desktop note: `npm run lock:check:<cadence>` can emit large hermit wrapper logs. Use `--json --quiet` (as documented above). If the command still fails due to Goose hermit issues, apply the PATH workaround in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` before rerunning.

3. Read policy file(s) once before the run loop. This step is conditional: if `AGENTS.md` is missing, continue without failing.

   ```bash
   test -f AGENTS.md && cat AGENTS.md || echo "No AGENTS.md found; continuing"
   ```

4. Bootstrap log directories before listing files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p <log_dir>
   ```

5. When lock health preflight is enabled (`scheduler.lockHealthPreflight: true` or env `SCHEDULER_LOCK_HEALTH_PREFLIGHT=1`), verify relay/query health before selecting an agent or calling `lock:lock`:

   ```bash
   npm run lock:health -- --cadence <cadence>
   ```

   - Escape hatch: set `SCHEDULER_SKIP_LOCK_HEALTH_PREFLIGHT=1` to skip this check for local/offline workflows.
   - If preflight exits non-zero because every relay is unhealthy, write `_deferred.md` with reason `All relays unhealthy preflight`, include `incident_signal_id`, set `failure_category: lock_backend_error`, state `prompt not executed`, and stop before lock acquisition.
   - For other non-zero preflight failures, write `_failed.md` with reason `Lock backend unavailable preflight`, set `failure_category: lock_backend_error`, state `prompt not executed`, and include:
     - `relay_list`
     - `preflight_failure_category`
     - `preflight_stderr_excerpt`
     - `preflight_stdout_excerpt`
   - Always include any preflight alert payload (`preflight_alerts`) in the scheduler metadata for operational triage.

6. Find latest cadence log file, derive the previous agent, then choose the next roster agent not in exclusion set:

   ```bash
   ls -1 <log_dir> | sort | tail -n 1
   ```

   Selection algorithm (MUST be followed exactly):

   - Roster source: `src/prompts/roster.json` and the key matching `<cadence>`.
   - Let `roster` be that ordered array and `excluded` be the set from step 2's canonical exclusion rule.
   - Let `latest_file` be the lexicographically last filename in `<log_dir>`.
   - Determine `previous_agent` from `latest_file` using this precedence:
     1. Parse YAML frontmatter from `<log_dir>/<latest_file>` and use key `agent` when present and non-empty.
     2. Otherwise parse filename convention `<timestamp>__<agent-name>__<status>.md` and take `<agent-name>`.
   - If no valid `latest_file` exists, or parsing fails, or `previous_agent` is not in `roster`, treat as first run fallback.
   - First run fallback:
     - Read `scheduler.firstPromptByCadence.<cadence>` from `torch-config.json` if present.
     - If that agent exists in `roster`, set `start_index = index(configured_agent)`.
     - Otherwise set `start_index = 0`.
   - Otherwise: `start_index = (index(previous_agent in roster) + 1) mod len(roster)`.
   - Round-robin scan:
     - Iterate offsets `0..len(roster)-1`.
     - Candidate index: `(start_index + offset) mod len(roster)` (wrap-around required).
     - Choose the first candidate whose agent is **not** in `excluded`.
   - If no candidate is eligible, execute step 7.

   Worked examples:

   - **Daily example**
     - `roster.daily = [audit-agent, ci-health-agent, const-refactor-agent, ...]`
     - `latest_file = 2026-02-13T00-10-00Z__ci-health-agent__completed.md`
     - `excluded = {const-refactor-agent, docs-agent}`
     - `previous_agent = ci-health-agent`, so `start_index` points to `const-refactor-agent`.
     - `const-refactor-agent` is excluded; skip to `content-audit-agent`.
     - **Selection result: `content-audit-agent`.**

   - **Weekly example**
     - `roster.weekly = [bug-reproducer-agent, changelog-agent, ..., weekly-synthesis-agent]`
     - `latest_file = 2026-02-09T00-00-00Z__weekly-synthesis-agent__completed.md`
     - `excluded = {}`
     - `previous_agent = weekly-synthesis-agent` (last roster entry), so `start_index = 0` by wrap-around.
     - First candidate is `bug-reproducer-agent` and is eligible.
     - **Selection result: `bug-reproducer-agent`.**

7. If every roster agent is excluded, write a `_failed.md` log with:
   `All roster tasks currently claimed by other agents` and stop.

8. Claim selected agent:

   ```bash
   AGENT_PLATFORM=<platform> \
   npm run lock:lock -- --agent <agent-name> --cadence <cadence>
   ```

   - Exit `0`: lock acquired, continue.
   - Exit `3`: race lost/already locked, return to step 2.
   - Exit `2`: lock backend error.
     - If `scheduler.strict_lock` is `false`, defer the run while both budget constraints are still satisfied:
       - `degraded_lock_retry_window` (ms) since first backend failure has not elapsed.
       - `max_deferrals` has not been exceeded.
       - Record deferral metadata in scheduler run state (`attempt_count`, `first_failure_timestamp`, `backend_category`, and preserved idempotency key).
     - Otherwise write `_failed.md` with reason `Lock backend error`, and include failure metadata fields:
     - `backend_category` (classified backend failure category)
     - `lock_command` (raw lock command for retry)
     - `lock_stderr_excerpt` (redacted stderr snippet)
     - `lock_stdout_excerpt` (redacted stdout snippet)
     - Include `failure_class: backend_unavailable` and `failure_category: lock_backend_error` for both deferred and failed backend-unavailable lock outcomes.
    - Include recommended auto-remediation text in `detail`: retry window, `npm run lock:health -- --cadence <cadence>`, and incident runbook link.
   - Keep generic reason text for compatibility, but append actionable retry guidance in `detail` using the command from `lock_command`.

9. Execute `<prompt_dir>/<prompt-file>` end-to-end via configured handoff command.

   - Scheduler automation runs `scheduler.handoffCommandByCadence.<cadence>` with environment variables for cadence/agent/prompt path.
   - If no handoff command is configured for the cadence, write `_failed.md` and stop.
   - Prompt file read/parse failures should emit `failure_category: prompt_parse_error`.
   - Prompt schema/contract failures should emit `failure_category: prompt_schema_error`.
   - Command/handoff/validation runtime failures should emit `failure_category: execution_error`.

10. Confirm memory contract completion:

   - Memory retrieval evidence must exist for this run (output marker and/or artifact file).
   - Memory storage evidence must exist for this run (output marker and/or artifact file).
   - Enforced daily/weekly commands in `torch-config.json` run `node --input-type=module` snippets that call `src/services/memory/index.js` APIs directly:
     - Retrieval path: `ingestEvents(...)` seed + `getRelevantMemories(...)` retrieval.
     - Storage path: `ingestEvents(...)` (ingestor + summarizer path).
   - Input contract for retrieval evidence JSON:
     - Required keys: `cadence`, `operation: "retrieve"`, `servicePath`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `status: "ok"`.
     - `inputs` must include `agentId`, `query`, and seeded `events` count.
     - `outputs` must include `ingestedCount` and `retrievedCount`.
   - Input contract for storage evidence JSON:
     - Required keys: `cadence`, `operation: "store"`, `servicePath`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `status: "ok"`.
     - `inputs` must include `agentId` and input `events` count.
     - `outputs` must include `storedCount` and generated `summaries`.
   - Failure semantics for required mode:
     - If retrieval/store command exits non-zero, scheduler writes `_failed.md` and stops.
     - If command succeeds but markers/artifacts are missing, scheduler treats this as missing memory evidence.
   - Prompt authors MUST keep any command changes aligned with configured markers/artifacts so scheduler evidence checks remain satisfiable.
   - If `scheduler.memoryPolicyByCadence.<cadence>.mode = required`, missing evidence is a hard failure.
   - If mode is `optional`, log warning context and continue.

11. Verify required run artifacts for the current run window.

    - Scheduler runs `node scripts/agent/verify-run-artifacts.mjs --since <run-start-iso> --check-failure-notes`.
    - If artifact verification exits non-zero: write `_failed.md` and stop.

12. Run repository checks (for example: `npm run lint`).

    - If any validation command exits non-zero: **fail the run immediately**, write `_failed.md` with the failing command and reason, and stop.
    - step 12 MUST NOT be executed (`lock:complete` is forbidden until validation passes).
    - In current numbering: when step 12 fails, step 13 MUST NOT run.

13. Publish completion before writing final success log:

    ```bash
    AGENT_PLATFORM=<platform> \
    npm run lock:complete -- --agent <agent-name> --cadence <cadence>
    ```

    (Equivalent invocation is allowed: `torch-lock complete --agent <agent-name> --cadence <cadence>`.)

    - Exit `0`: completion published successfully; continue to step 14.
    - Exit non-zero: **fail the run**, write `_failed.md` with a clear reason that completion publish failed and retry guidance (for example: `Retry npm run lock:complete -- --agent <agent-name> --cadence <cadence> after verifying relay connectivity`), then stop.

14. Create final task log only after step 13 succeeds (scheduler-owned):

    - `_completed.md` MUST be created only after completion publish succeeds.
    - `_failed.md` is required when step 11, step 12, or step 13 fails, and should include the failure reason and next retry action.
    - Include `platform` in frontmatter using `AGENT_PLATFORM` (or the scheduler `--platform` value) for both `_completed.md` and `_failed.md`.

15. Commit/push behavior is delegated outside this scheduler script.

    - `scripts/agent/run-scheduler-cycle.mjs` does **not** run `git commit` or `git push`.
    - If commit/push is required for your workflow, perform it in the configured handoff agent command or a separate orchestration step.

Worked post-task example (MUST order):

1. `AGENT_PLATFORM=codex npm run lock:lock -- --agent content-audit-agent --cadence daily`
2. Execute `src/prompts/daily/content-audit-agent.md`
3. `node scripts/agent/verify-run-artifacts.mjs --since <run-start-iso> --check-failure-notes`
4. `AGENT_PLATFORM=codex npm run lock:complete -- --agent content-audit-agent --cadence daily` (complete, permanent)
5. Write `task-logs/daily/2026-02-14T10-00-00Z__content-audit-agent__completed.md`

Worked validation-failure example (MUST behavior):

1. `AGENT_PLATFORM=codex npm run lock:lock -- --agent content-audit-agent --cadence daily`
2. Execute `src/prompts/daily/content-audit-agent.md`
3. `node scripts/agent/verify-run-artifacts.mjs --since <run-start-iso> --check-failure-notes` passes
4. `npm run lint` exits non-zero (or `npm test` exits non-zero)
5. Write `task-logs/daily/2026-02-14T10-00-00Z__content-audit-agent__failed.md` with the failing command and reason
6. Stop the run **without** calling `npm run lock:complete -- --agent content-audit-agent --cadence daily`
