## Summary
- Total PRs/Merges detected: ~100 (high velocity week)
- Total issues created: N/A (Local-only view)
- Notable themes:
  - **Core Refactoring:** Major decomposition of `src/lib.mjs` into modular components (`lock-ops`, `ops`, `dashboard`, `roster`, `torch-config`).
  - **Memory System:** Implementation of persistent JSON memory store, vector-aware retrieval (currently text-match), and memory pruning.
  - **Locking Mechanism:** Introduction of `lock:complete` for permanent history and configurable hashtags.
  - **Dashboard & Landing:** Significant UI improvements, including pagination, documentation modals, and a new landing page with natural language install prompts.

## Issues Created / Updated
*Based on task logs.*

- **deps-security-agent** — Failed (2026-02-15) — Priority: P1
  - Notes: Failed run. Needs investigation.
  - Risk: Security

- **event-schema-agent** — Failed (Twice on 2026-02-14) — Priority: P2
  - Notes: Persistent failure in event schema validation/generation.
  - Risk: Protocol

- **interop-agent** — Failed (2026-02-14) — Priority: P2
  - Notes: Interoperability check failure.
  - Risk: Protocol

- **prompt-maintenance-agent** — Failed (2026-02-14) — Priority: P3
  - Notes: Prompt maintenance task failed.
  - Risk: Maintenance

## Tests / Quality
- **Tests added/updated:**
  - `test-coverage-agent` completed successfully (2026-02-16).
  - Added unit tests for `parseLockEvent`, `src/torch-config.mjs`, and `lock-ops`.
  - Added `test:ci-resilience` suite.
  - Added `test:integration:e2e` suite.

- **Coverage:**
  - `test-coverage-agent` ran, but specific numbers are not in the log summary.

## Security / Dependencies
- **deps-security-agent** — Failed run on 2026-02-15.
  - Rationale: Needs immediate review to ensure no vulnerabilities are missed.

## Requires Human Review (Do Not Auto-Merge)
- **deps-security-agent failure**: Check why it failed.
- **Core Refactoring changes**: Verify `src/lib.mjs` decomposition didn't introduce regressions (though tests seem to have been added).
- **Memory System**: Review the new JSON-based memory store implementation.

## Top 5 Recommended Human Actions (ranked)
1. **Investigate `deps-security-agent` failure**: Ensure security scans are running correctly.
2. **Review `event-schema-agent` failures**: Fix schema validation or generation issues to prevent protocol drift.
3. **Validate `src/lib.mjs` decomposition**: Ensure all CLI commands (`lock`, `list`, `health`) work as expected after refactoring (manual smoke test recommended).
4. **Review `interop-agent` failure**: Check for cross-client compatibility issues.
5. **Monitor Memory System**: Watch for storage growth in `.scheduler-memory/` and verify retrieval accuracy.

## Method & Limitations
- Data sources used: `git log --all` and `task-logs/` directory listing.
- Limitations: Cannot query GitHub API for open PRs or Issues. Status inferred from commit messages and log files.
